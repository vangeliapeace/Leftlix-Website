# Leftlix-Website
Building a front-end website is one of my 4th semester projects for the Human Computer Interaction Course. I was given an assignment to create a Letflix website (similar to Netflix) based on the requirements they had listed on the question paper.

I built this using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make it interactive and responsive. Enjoy!

❗ There are some of the same designs & wording as Netflix has, I'm more focused on the code that I built. ❗ <br>
